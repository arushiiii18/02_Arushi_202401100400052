This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies job postings as real or fake based on various features such as title length, description length, and the presence of a company profile. The model uses a Logistic Regression algorithm to make predictions, and evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess its performance. Additionally, confusion matrix heatmaps are used for visual representation of the model's predictions.

Objective
Predict whether a job posting is real or fake based on text-based features.

Evaluate model performance using classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
